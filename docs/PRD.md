# Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Name

**Weather-Based Smart Irrigation Advisory System**

---

# 2. Product Summary

The Weather-Based Smart Irrigation Advisory System is a full-stack web application prototype designed to help farmers make basic irrigation decisions using live weather information.

The system allows farmers to:

* Create an account
* Register one or more farms
* Select farm locations using OpenStreetMap
* Fetch current weather using farm coordinates
* Receive rule-based irrigation recommendations
* View weather and recommendation history
* Manage farm and profile information

The project is intended for academic demonstration and college submission.

It is not intended to replace professional agricultural guidance or real farm-monitoring systems.

---

# 3. Product Vision

Create a simple, reliable, and user-friendly web platform that demonstrates how live weather data and location-based services can support irrigation decisions.

The system should provide a clear workflow:

```txt
Register
   ↓
Login
   ↓
Add Farm
   ↓
Select Location
   ↓
Fetch Weather
   ↓
Generate Recommendation
   ↓
View History
```

The product should appear professional while remaining manageable for a college-level implementation.

---

# 4. Problem Statement

Farmers may irrigate fields without checking current weather conditions or upcoming rainfall.

This can result in:

* Unnecessary irrigation
* Water wastage
* Electricity wastage
* Irrigation immediately before rainfall
* Poor irrigation planning
* Difficulty tracking previous decisions

A simple weather-based advisory application can help users understand whether irrigation may be required based on current conditions.

---

# 5. Proposed Solution

The proposed system provides a web-based dashboard where farmers can:

1. Register and log in.
2. Add farm information.
3. Select the farm location on an India map.
4. Save latitude and longitude.
5. Fetch live weather information.
6. Apply predefined irrigation rules.
7. Display a simple irrigation recommendation.
8. Save weather and recommendation records.
9. Review previous history.

The system uses live weather data but does not use machine learning, IoT sensors, or automatic irrigation control.

---

# 6. Product Goals

The main product goals are:

* Build a complete full-stack web application.
* Demonstrate weather API integration.
* Demonstrate OpenStreetMap integration.
* Generate simple weather-based irrigation recommendations.
* Store user, farm, weather, and recommendation data.
* Provide a responsive farmer dashboard.
* Protect user data with authentication.
* Maintain clean and modular project architecture.
* Make the project easy to explain during viva.
* Create a foundation for future agricultural features.

---

# 7. Non-Goals

The current product will not:

* Use Machine Learning
* Use AI prediction models
* Use soil-moisture sensors
* Control irrigation pumps
* Automate irrigation
* Use satellite images
* Use drone monitoring
* Predict crop yield
* Diagnose crop diseases
* Guarantee irrigation accuracy
* Replace agricultural experts
* Support commercial-scale farm management
* Process payments

These may be considered future enhancements.

---

elif humidity > 80:
    recommendation = "Delay Irrigation"

elif temperature > 35:
    recommendation = "Irrigate Today"

else:
    recommendation = "Monitor Weather"
```

## Rule Explanation

### Rain Probability Above 60%

```txt
Result:
No Irrigation Required
```

Reason:

Expected rainfall may provide sufficient water.

### Humidity Above 80%

```txt
Result:
Delay Irrigation
```

Reason:

High humidity may reduce immediate water loss.

### Temperature Above 35°C

```txt
Result:
Irrigate Today
```

Reason:

High temperature may increase water demand.

### Default

```txt
Result:
Monitor Weather
```

Reason:

No critical irrigation condition was detected.

The recommendation is advisory only.

* Allow map reset

## Risk 3: Unauthorized Data Access

Impact:

User privacy may be compromised.

Mitigation:

* Use JWT
* Check ownership
* Validate every protected endpoint

## Risk 4: Rule Limitations

Impact:

Recommendations may not fit every crop.

Mitigation:

* Display disclaimer
* Clearly state weather-only logic
* Add crop-specific rules in future

## Risk 5: Mobile Layout Problems

Impact:

Farmers may not use the system easily.

Mitigation:
