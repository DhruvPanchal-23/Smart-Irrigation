# 8. Farm Ownership

Each farm must belong to one farmer.

```txt
Farmer
   │
   └── Can own multiple farms
```

A farmer can access only farms that belong to their own account.

## Ownership Rule

```txt

View Own Farms
View Own Farm Details
Edit Own Farm
Delete Own Farm
View Weather for Own Farm
Generate Recommendation for Own Farm
View History for Own Farm
```

# 10. Farm Location Selection

The farmer selects a farm location using OpenStreetMap.

## Map Interaction Flow

```txt
Farmer opens Add Farm page
          │
          ▼
OpenStreetMap is displayed
          │
          ▼
Farmer clicks farm location
          │
          ▼
Marker is placed
          │
          ▼
Latitude and longitude are captured
          │
          ▼
Coordinates are saved with farm
```

The farmer must not be allowed to submit a farm without selecting a valid location.

---

# 11. Weather Access

A farmer can request weather information for a registered farm.

The system should display:

* Current temperature
* Humidity
* Wind speed
* Atmospheric pressure
* Rain probability
* Weather condition
* Weather description
* Last updated time

## Weather Access Flow

```txt
Farmer selects farm
        │

        │
        ▼
Backend loads latitude and longitude
        │
        ▼
Backend calls weather API
        │
        ▼
Weather data is returned
```

A farmer should not manually provide weather values.

Weather information should come from the external weather API.

---

# 12. Irrigation Recommendation Access

A farmer can generate an irrigation recommendation for a registered farm.

The recommendation is based on:

* Rain probability
* Temperature
* Humidity
* Current weather condition

## Recommendation Results

Possible recommendation results:

```txt
No Irrigation Required
Delay Irrigation
Irrigate Today
Monitor Weather
```

## Recommendation Rule Examples

```txt
Rain probability above 60%
→ No Irrigation Required

Humidity above 80%
→ Delay Irrigation

Temperature above 35°C
→ Irrigate Today

Otherwise
→ Monitor Weather
```

## Farmer Recommendation View

The farmer should see:

* Farm name
* Current weather summary
* Recommendation status
* Reason
* Recommended action
* Recommendation date
* Advisory disclaimer

## Disclaimer

The interface should display:

```txt
This recommendation is based only on weather information and predefined rules.
It should be treated as an advisory and not as a replacement for professional agricultural guidance.
```
