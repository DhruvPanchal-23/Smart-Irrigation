---

# 31. Acceptance Criteria

## Registration

* Valid user can register
* Duplicate email is rejected
* Invalid email is rejected
* Password mismatch is rejected
* Password is hashed
* Default role is farmer

## Login

* Valid user can log in
* Invalid credentials are rejected
* Token is returned
* User is redirected to dashboard
* Expired token is rejected

## Farm Management

* Farmer can add a farm
* Location is required
* Coordinates are stored
* Farmer can view owned farms
* Farmer can edit owned farms
* Farmer can delete owned farms
* Farmer cannot access another user's farm

## Weather

* Weather is fetched using saved coordinates

* Weather values are displayed with units
* Weather history is stored
* API failures are handled

## Recommendation

* Rules run in correct priority
* Rain above 60% returns No Irrigation Required
* Humidity above 80% returns Delay Irrigation

---

# 32. Project Constraints

The project is constrained by:

* Dependence on internet connectivity
* Dependence on weather API availability
* Dependence on weather forecast accuracy
* No soil-moisture measurements
* No crop-specific scientific calculation
* No automatic irrigation control
* Rule-based advisory only
* Limited academic project timeline
* Limited development and deployment budget

The system must not be presented as a guaranteed agricultural decision tool.

---

# 33. Future Requirements

Future versions may add:

* Soil-moisture sensors
* IoT devices
* Crop-specific rules
* Automatic pump control
* Machine Learning prediction
* SMS notifications
* WhatsApp notifications
* Multi-language support
* Mobile application
* Admin dashboard
* Regional weather alerts
* Government agriculture integration
* Report export
* Redis caching
* Role-based agricultural experts
* Fertigation recommendations
* Yield estimation

These features are outside the current implementation scope.
