Dashboard Documentation

1. Document Purpose

This document defines the dashboard structure, analytical cards, charts, weather panels, recommendation panels, tables, interactions, responsive behaviour, data requirements, and implementation rules for the Weather-Based Smart Irrigation Advisory System.

The dashboard is the main authenticated screen shown after login. It helps the farmer quickly understand:

Registered farms and total farm area

The currently selected farm

Current temperature and humidity

Wind speed and rainfall probability

Irrigation recommendation

Seven-day weather trends

Recommendation distribution

Farm information and location

Recent weather and recommendation history

Important weather alerts

2. Dashboard Main Goal

The dashboard should immediately answer:

Which farm am I viewing?
What is the current weather?
Is rain expected?
What is the wind speed?
Should I irrigate today?
What weather pattern has occurred recently?
What recommendations were generated recently?
Are there any important alerts?

22. Recommended React Component Structure

pages/
└── Dashboard.jsx

components/dashboard/
├── DashboardHeader.jsx
├── FarmSelector.jsx
├── SummaryCard.jsx
├── SummaryGrid.jsx
├── CurrentWeatherPanel.jsx
├── RecommendationPanel.jsx
├── TemperatureHumidityChart.jsx
├── RainProbabilityChart.jsx
├── WindSpeedChart.jsx
├── RecommendationPieChart.jsx
├── WeatherConditionPieChart.jsx
├── FarmInformationPanel.jsx
├── FarmMapPanel.jsx
├── RecentWeatherTable.jsx
├── RecentRecommendationTable.jsx
├── QuickActions.jsx
└── WeatherAlerts.jsx

These components may be added to the current frontend structure.

23. Dashboard Page Responsibilities

pages/Dashboard.jsx should:

Read the authenticated user.

Fetch owned farms.

Select a default farm.

Manage selected farm ID.

Fetch dashboard data.

Coordinate dashboard components.

Handle page-level loading.

Handle partial failures.

Avoid containing chart implementation details.

Avoid direct Axios configuration.

24. Suggested Dashboard State

const [farms, setFarms] = useState([]);
const [selectedFarmId, setSelectedFarmId] = useState("");
const [currentWeather, setCurrentWeather] = useState(null);
const [latestRecommendation, setLatestRecommendation] = useState(null);
const [weatherHistory, setWeatherHistory] = useState([]);
const [recommendationHistory, setRecommendationHistory] = useState([]);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
const [refreshing, setRefreshing] = useState(false);
const [error, setError] = useState("");

Prefer existing custom hooks rather than duplicating state logic.

25. Loading States

Required loading messages:

Loading dashboard...
Loading farms...
Fetching current weather...
Loading weather trends...
Loading recommendation...
Refreshing dashboard...

Use:

Skeleton summary cards

Skeleton chart cards

Spinner in refresh button

Inline loaders for individual panels

Do not hide the complete dashboard when only one section is refreshing.

26. Empty States

No Farms

No farms added yet.
Add your first farm to view weather information and irrigation recommendations.

Action:

Add Farm

No Weather History

No weather history is available for this farm.

No Recommendation

No recommendation has been generated yet.

Action:

Generate Recommendation

No Alerts

No active weather alerts.

27. Error States

Unable to load dashboard information.
Unable to fetch current weather.
Unable to load the latest recommendation.
Unable to display the farm location.
Unable to connect to the server.

Each recoverable error should provide a retry action.

28. Partial Failure Behaviour

The dashboard must not fail completely when one section fails.

Example:

Farms load successfully
Weather fails
Recommendation history loads successfully

Expected behaviour:

Show farm information.

Show recommendation history.

Show a weather error only in the weather panel.

Keep all unaffected sections visible.

29. Responsive Design

Mobile

Collapse the sidebar into a drawer.

Stack summary cards.

Use a one-column layout.

Keep charts readable.

Allow tables to scroll horizontally.

Make the farm selector full width.

Keep the map usable.

Use touch-friendly controls.

Tablet

Use a two-column card layout.

Stack large charts when required.

Keep recommendation and weather panels readable.

Desktop

Use a fixed sidebar.

Use multiple summary cards per row.

Use a multi-column chart layout.

Place current weather, trend, and recommendation side by side where space allows.

Test widths:

320px
375px
425px
768px
1024px
1280px
1440px

30. Accessibility Rules

The dashboard should:

Use semantic headings.

Add labels to the farm selector.

Add aria-label to the refresh button.

Use text and icons for status.

Avoid colour-only meaning.

Support keyboard navigation.

Provide visible focus states.

Use readable contrast.

Use proper table headings.

Announce important errors.

Provide accessible chart descriptions where possible.

31. Performance Rules

Avoid duplicate API requests.

Fetch farm-specific data only after a valid farm is selected.

Cache the farm list in state.

Avoid recreating chart data unnecessarily.

Limit recent history rows.

Paginate full history pages.

Avoid saving duplicate weather history during rapid refreshes.

Lazy-load heavy chart components where useful.

32. Security Rules

The dashboard must:

Display only the authenticated user's farms.

Use protected API endpoints.

Rely on backend ownership verification.

Never display password hashes.

Never expose the weather API key.

Clear private data after logout.

Handle expired authentication safely.

33. Dashboard Acceptance Criteria

The dashboard is ready when:

Welcome message displays correctly.

Farm selector loads owned farms.

Selected farm updates all relevant sections.

Total farms and total area display correctly.

Temperature, humidity, rain probability, and wind speed display.

Current weather panel works.

Latest recommendation displays.

No unauthorized farm data is shown.

34. Rules for Codex

Codex must:

Follow this dashboard structure.

Use reusable components.

Use backend data for live weather.

Use MongoDB history for charts.

Use backend recommendation data.

Add a farm selector.

Add summary cards.

Farms
Farm area
Current weather
Temperature
Humidity
Wind speed
Rainfall probability
Irrigation recommendation
Weather trends
Recommendation trends
Farm location
Recent history
Weather alerts
Quick actions

The dashboard must remain:
